function [BW_object, plotSkel] = getFaultDetection(z, z_orig, SLC)
% getFaultDetection - Detects faults, cleans the resulting binary map, and generates visualizations.
% This function uses hysteresis thresholding via the 'binarize' sub-function and then refines
% the output by removing noise and reconnecting broken lineaments.
%
% Inputs:
%   z        (2D matrix): Processed data (e.g., filtered, gradient) used for detection.
%   z_orig   (2D matrix): Original, unprocessed data used for the background of the visualization.
%   SLC      (double):    A sensitivity parameter passed to the binarize function to set the initial threshold.
%
% Outputs:
%   BW_object (binary matrix): The final, cleaned binary map where '1' indicates a detected fault.
%   plotSkel  (RGB matrix):    An RGB image showing the detected faults
%   overlaid on the original data.  7.

function [B1] = binarize(z, SLC)
% binarize - Converts input data into a binary fault map using hysteresis thresholding.
% This method identifies prominent features (strong faults) and then grows them into
% connected, weaker regions.
%
% Inputs:
%   z  (2D matrix): Processed input data where high values indicate potential faults.
%   SLC (double):   A sensitivity factor (e.g., 1.0) to control the initial threshold. Higher
%                   values make the initial selection less sensitive (requires stronger features).
%
% Outputs:
%   B1 (binary matrix): A raw binary map where '1' indicates a detected fault region.

% Iteratively connect undecided pixels (0) to adjacent strong fault pixels (1).
